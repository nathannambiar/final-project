title: "The Progression Of Agent Pick Rates in Valorant"
description: |
  Valorant is a free-to-play online FPS game, involving two teams of 5 players each and various agents with unique abilities. Since the game's inception 2 years ago, new agents have been introduced that have influenced individual playstyles and subequent pick rates. For my final project, I will be analyzing the progression of agent pick rates in Valorant over the episodes (seasons of the game) in order to identify which agents are most favoured.
