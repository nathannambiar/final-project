Understanding this can\r\ngive insight into the diverse “play styles” used in competitive\r\ngameplay, as well as the community’s outlook on the updates from Riot\r\nGames.\r\nGoals\r\nCreate a bar graph of the agent-specific pick rates\r\nUse ‘gganimate’ to create a time-based visualization\r\n\r\nDetermine the most favored and least favored agents of each class\r\nThe four classes of agents: duelist, initiator, sentinel, and\r\ncontroller\r\n\r\n“This is Data Science”\r\n\r\nPreceptor\r\n\r\nKane’s Free High School\r\nData Science Bootcamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
